  title: "Why not WordPress?"
  body: "Sites like WordPress and SquareSpace (AKA 'CMS Sites') are great if they meet your needs. But they can also be too big. CMS are great for larger projects that have a lot of activity but a little heavy handed for simple splash pages with some static content. Also, a basic WordPress project is going to start around $1,000 so I can get you a good looking site for much cheaper."

  title: "What about revisions?"
  body: "Each of the items on the price list describe the kind of revisions that are free vs. paid. The biggest difference is the amount of time it will take to make the revision. If it's something small, I'm happy to do it at no charge. If it's big, I'll either point you to something on the price list or it will give you a proposal that will be based on my hourly rate. Just let me know what you want and I'll let you know."
